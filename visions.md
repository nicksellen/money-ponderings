# Visions

I often wonder what to do with my life. To me it's part of a cycle between focused directed work (where I know more-or-less what I'm doing) and drifting/searching.

I like this passage from the bible (_Ecclesiastes 3:1-8_) that seems to include some of these concepts (I'm not religious or anything, honest!):

> To every thing there is a season,
> and a time to every purpose under the heaven:
> A time to be born, a time to die;
> a time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted;
> A time to kill, and a time to heal;
> a time to break down, and a time to build up;
> A time to weep, and a time to laugh;
> a time to mourn, and a time to dance;
> A time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together;
> a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing;
> A time to get, and a time to lose;
> a time to keep, and a time to cast away;
> A time to rend, and a time to sew;
> a time to keep silence, and a time to speak;
> A time to love, and a time to hate;
> A time of war, and a time of peace.

I've been feeling more in the direction of _cast away_, _lose_, _cast away stones_, _break down_. But beginning to feel the need to _embrace_, _build up_, _sew_, _plant_, and _gather stones together_.
