# Reinventing Liberalism: Early Neoliberalism in Context, 1920 – 1947

I had been chatting with Doug this morning, and about my sense of Neoliberalism as a approximately "possibly good idea in it's time" as a response to fascism/totalitarianism. I wasn't entirely sure where I had got the sense from, I think from a combination of books I had read.

I thought about seeing what the internet had to say and googled for _"mont pelerin society fascism totalitarianism"_ - the second result was the PhD thesis from Ola Innset.

I have to admit that I did not read it all - just a bit of the introduction and the whole conclusion, but was very interesting :)

The conclusion explained clearly how we got to where we are - where the economic reality of our lives is detirmined by market ideology and democratic participation is left out of this.

My little summary:
- Neoliberalism is not wanting to _get rid of_ the state, but use it to to create and enforce market mechanisms
- the ideas were forming in the interwar years and as an alternative to fascism, communism, and socialism - all of which involve a powerful state (and they wanted away from the centralized power)
- over time the market fundemantalism increased, and the criticisms of the power of large corporations went away
- Neoliberalism is about more than just economics, but also how we understand ourselves as humans - that altruism does not scale, so we need markets

These are the sections that seemed particularly interesting to me (I am too lazy to write more about what I thought about these passages).

> Apart from Mises, there was strong agreement that the rise of large corporations was a major problem with modern capitalism, which distorted the proper functioning of the price mechanism, and thus needed to be addressed by state action in the name of liberalism and competitive markets. The degree to which this critique of corporations disappeared from the neoliberal agenda in later years is striking, and indeed worthy of a thesis of its own.

> Principles of market competition have been imposed both on the internal organization of states and the public sector, and in how nation states compete with other states on a global market.
> Compared to these ideas, the early neoliberals gathered at Mont Pèlerin do seem moderate, pragmatic and nuanced.
> The gist of their discussions focused on how to use the state to avoid monopolies and power concentrations.

> If early neoliberalism seems moderate to us today, it was no such thing in its own time: the ideas of the Mont Pelerin Society members were considered rather fringe and about as right wing as possible in the context of the immediate post-war years. It is indeed possible that the fact that they appear moderate from today’s perspective says more about our own time than it does about the ideas in question.

> My point is that later, more “extreme” versions of neoliberalism than the ones on display in the 1930s and 40s are not deviations from, but rather logical continuations of the pioneering efforts of early neoliberal intellectuals.

> The notion that a modern society can only function through market mechanisms is the core idea that allowed someone like Buchanan, in a very different context, to argue that public employees and even politicians had to be held in check by incentives and market-like structures.

> Fisher wrote: “He [Hayek] explained that the decisive influence in the great battle of ideas and policy was wielded by the intellectuals whom he characterised as ‘second-hand dealers in ideas’.” 32 Hayek would use this latter phrase and elaborate upon this strategy for achieving social change in his 1949 essay “The Intellectuals and Socialism”. More important than running for office, according to him, was to slowly influence intellectuals and opinion makers so that politicians wielding power would eventually do so in a society where neoliberal ideas were available as alternatives, or even dominant and seen as common sense

> In the introduction I asked what the relationship is between politics and the economy, and this thesis has shown that early neoliberalism very much amounted to a desire to keep democratic politics away from the economy. This was achieved with new ideas about how to use modern states to construct and support markets, but to also protect them from “interference”

> This is precisely what my study of early neoliberal thought has shown: neoliberalism is about much more than economic policies, it amounts to a theory of modernity. Wendy Brown has decried the reduction of “neoliberalism to a bundle of economic policies with inadvertent political and social consequences: they fail to address the political rationality that both organizes these policies and reaches beyond the market”

> Foucault once defined a political rationality as «le conduire des conduites», which translates roughly as “the conduct of conducts. It is not defined by specific policies, but rather by how we think about politics even before policies are designed.

> The neoliberals always considered socialism and indeed the whole workers’ movement an intellectual error. In later writing, Hayek would claim that the main problem with socialism was that it was based on an ethical principle, altruism, which according to him could only work in a tribal society in which everyone knows everyone else personally. According to him, modern, intertwined societies, could only work if organized as markets in which people act self-interestedly in competition with others. Unlike the caricature of neoliberalism we are often presented with, Hayek was well aware that people tend to act altruistically, but according to him, this was a problem in a modern, market-based society.
